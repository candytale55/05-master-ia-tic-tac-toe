# Prompt Reference for Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This document contains the prompts used to create this Tic-Tac-Toe application through AI-assisted development.

## Initial Prompt (Gemini)

Prompt used to generate GitHub Codex instructions:

```
I'm going to create a tic-tac-toe game using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I've already created the base files using the Next.js instructions. I need you to write a well-structured prompt for GitHub Codex to create the game, because I will use that prompt to generate all the base code. The project will be deployed in Netlify. Deliver the prompt in a md box ready to copy-paste.
```

## Generated Prompt (Used with GitHub Codex)

This prompt was generated by Gemini and used with GitHub Codex to create the application:

```
Role: Senior Next.js & DevOps Engineer.

Task: Create a responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game using Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, optimized for Netlify deployment.

1. Architecture & Code Standards:
- Client-Side Logic: Since the game requires state, the main logic must be in a "use client" component to prevent hydration errors.
- TypeScript: Use strict typing for all props and state to prevent Netlify build failures (no any types).
- Utility Logic: Separate the calculateWinner logic into a helper function outside the component.

2. Netlify & Production Optimization:
- Tailwind Config: Ensure the component is structured so that Tailwind's production purge (Content) will correctly identify all classes in the app/ and components/ directories.
- Error Handling: Ensure the game handles null states gracefully so the build-time static generation doesn't crash.
- Deployment Files: Please also provide a simple netlify.toml file configuration to ensure the build command (next build) and publish directory (.next) are explicitly defined.

3. Game Features:
- 3x3 Grid using Tailwind CSS Grid.
- Status indicator (Current Player / Winner / Draw).
- "Reset" functionality.
- Modern UI: Smooth transitions, hover effects on squares, and a mobile-friendly layout.

Deliverable: 
1. Code for app/page.tsx (the main game).
2. Code for a basic netlify.toml file for the root directory.
```

## Key Considerations for Netlify Deployment

### Client-Side Directive
Next.js defaults to Server Components. The `"use client"` directive is essential at the top of the file when using `useState` or `useEffect`, otherwise Netlify's build will fail.

### Netlify Configuration
While Netlify often auto-detects Next.js, having an explicit `netlify.toml` prevents common errors like "404 not found" on subpages or "Build command failed" during deployment.

### Strict TypeScript
Local development sometimes allows loose types, but Netlify's production build runs `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) which will block deployment if there are any type mismatches.

## Deployment Process

1. Log into Netlify
2. Select "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Netlify will automatically detect it's a Next.js project
5. Ensure the Build Command is `next build` and the Publish directory is `.next`
