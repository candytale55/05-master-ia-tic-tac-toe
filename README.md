**Live Demo:** [https://master-ia-codex-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app/](https://master-ia-codex-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app/)

**Completion Date:** January 30, 2026

## About This Project

This project was developed as an exercise from The Big School's [___Master de desarrollo con IA___](https://thebigschool.com/master-desarrollo-con-ia/), specifically Module 4: ___Flujo de Desarrollo con IA___.

The purpose of this exercise was to use GitHub Codex to create the project using a prompt generated by an AI assistant (Gemini). This demonstrates the workflow of AI-assisted development, where one AI tool helps craft the requirements and another builds the implementation.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
